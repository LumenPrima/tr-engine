TR-ENGINE (Event Network Gateway and Integration Node Engine)
A high-throughput trunk radio monitoring and analysis server that ingests MQTT message streams from multiple radio systems, processes them through a distributed event pipeline, and maintains real-time state while archiving to a time-series data store. The system implements an event-driven architecture with a focus on low-latency message processing, efficient state management, and scalable data persistence. Built around modern async processing patterns, TR-ENGINE handles concurrent message streams while providing both REST and WebSocket interfaces for real-time monitoring and historical analysis.
Key features:

Multi-threaded MQTT message ingestion
Persistent message queue with fail-safe processing
Time-series data storage with efficient indexing
Real-time state management with in-memory caching
WebSocket-based event streaming
RESTful API for historical queries
